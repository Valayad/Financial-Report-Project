I recently worked on a dynamic Power BI project that provided actionable insights into business profitability trends over time. Here's a snapshot of what I achieved:

ðŸ“ˆ Trend Analysis:

Total Profit showed remarkable growth, with a 165.29% increase between September 1, 2013, and December 1, 2014.
The most significant spike occurred from July 1, 2014, to December 1, 2014, where profit jumped 119.27% (an increase of $1,101,900) in just 5 months, reaching a peak of $2,025,766.
ðŸ“Š Segment Contribution:

The Government segment within the Paseo Product category contributed significantly, accounting for 16.87% of Total Profit during the period.
ðŸ’¡ Outcome:
This analysis equipped stakeholders with clear visibility into revenue drivers and timeframes of growth, empowering them to make informed strategic decisions.

This project honed my skills in:
âœ… Advanced Power BI dashboards for trend visualization.
âœ… Leveraging data to uncover key business insights.
âœ… Communicating findings to enable data-driven decision-making.

Looking forward to applying these insights to future projects! Let's connect and discuss how data can drive growth in your business.
